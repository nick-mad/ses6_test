# [GitHub Release Notification API](https://mykhailo-hrynko.github.io/se-school/task/description.html)

Build an API that allows users to subscribe to email notifications about new releases of a chosen GitHub repository.
Endpoints

## Implement the following endpoints:
- POST /api/subscribe - Subscribe an email to release notifications for a given GitHub repository (format: owner/repo)
- GET /api/confirm/{token} - Confirm email subscription
- GET /api/unsubscribe/{token} - Unsubscribe from release notifications
- GET /api/subscriptions?email={email} - Get all active subscriptions for a given email

**Note:** swagger.yaml file contains API documentation. You can view it using Swagger Editor. Changing the contracts is not allowed.

## Requirements

1. The service must match the API described in the swagger documentation.
2. All functionality (API, Scanner, Notifier) must be implemented within a single service (monolith). Splitting into microservices is not allowed at this stage.
3. All application data must be stored in a database. Database schema migrations must run on service startup.
4. The repository must contain Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml that allow running the entire system in Docker.
5. The service must regularly check for new releases for all active subscriptions. When a new release is detected, send an email to the subscriber. For each repository, store last_seen_tag and only notify if a new release appears.
6. When creating a subscription, the service must verify the repository exists via GitHub API. Parameter format: owner/repo (e.g., golang/go). If the repository is not found - return 404. If the format is invalid - return 400.
7. The service must correctly handle 429 Too Many Requests from GitHub API (rate limit: 60 req/hour without token, 5000 with token).
8. You may use frameworks, but only “thin” solutions. High-level frameworks are prohibited: Nest.js (Node.js), Revel or Fx (Go), Laravel (PHP). Allowed: Fastify or Express (Node.js), Gin / Chi / net/http (Go), Slim or built-in language capabilities (PHP).
9. Unit tests for business logic are mandatory. Integration tests are a bonus.
10. You may add comments or logic descriptions in README.md. Correct logic can be an advantage in evaluation if you don’t fully complete the task.

Expected languages: Golang, Node.js, or PHP.

## Extras
- Deploy the API to a hosting + HTML page for subscribing to releases
- gRPC interface as an alternative or addition to REST API
- Redis caching of GitHub API responses with TTL 10 minutes
- API key authentication: endpoints secured with a token in the header
- Prometheus metrics - /metrics endpoint with basic service indicators
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline: run linter and tests on every push
